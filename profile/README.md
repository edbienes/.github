## Hi there 👋

I'm Ed — a software engineer focused on blockchain infrastructure and mobile development.

Currently building **[Clad Sovereign](https://github.com/clad-sovereign)**, my first open-source project — a
tokenization toolkit for sovereign and emerging-market real-world assets on Polkadot/Substrate.

### What I work with
- **Blockchain**: Rust, Substrate/FRAME, Polkadot SDK
- **Mobile**: Kotlin Multiplatform, iOS/Android
- **Infrastructure**: DevOps, CI/CD, containerization

### Current focus
- Compliance-first tokenization for finance ministries and sovereign debt
- Mobile-native signing experiences (because browser extensions don't work on mobile)
- Production-grade tooling for debt-management offices and central banks

### About me
I'm the founder of **[Wideas Technologies](https://www.wideas.tech)** since 2022, a consultancy focused on web and
mobile solutions. Clad Sovereign is where I'm channeling my blockchain focus — building infrastructure I
believe the market needs.
